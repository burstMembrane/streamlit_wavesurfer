Rules:

When coding in react - be aware of the rules of react.
Keep logic and ui seperate where possible by utilizing inline hooks separate from component code.
Ensure you use the latest React best practices.
Ensure type safety with props, data structures and state
DO NOT use excessive `useEffect` for mutations. Instead use refs to ensure any non-ui related values are able to be updated without component re-render.
DO NOT add excessive commenting - code should be self docuemnting when the types, variable names and functions are read.
Prefer creating smaller pure functions to larger ones with a lot of side-effects. We want our code to be testable and debuggable.
When console.logging - prefer this pattern `[module_name](function_name) <log value>`


Prefer the use of:

`shadcn/ui` for a component library
`tailwindcss` for CSS implementations
`useQuery` for data fetching
`useMutation` for mutations
